# Weather
The Weather App is a simple web application that provides real-time weather updates for any city. It fetches data from the OpenWeather API and displays key weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and dynamically updates the user interface based on the fetched data.
