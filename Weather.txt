Weather App - Project Description 🌦️
Overview
The Weather App is a web application that provides real-time weather updates for any city worldwide. It integrates with the OpenWeather API to fetch and display weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, and descriptions. The app dynamically updates the UI with weather details and relevant emojis/icons, providing users with an interactive experience.

Features
✔ City-Based Weather Search: Users can input any city name to retrieve weather data.
✔ Live API Data Fetching: Utilizes the OpenWeather API to fetch real-time weather conditions.
✔ Temperature & Humidity Display: Shows temperature (in Celsius) and humidity percentage.
✔ Weather Condition Description: Provides a brief text-based summary (e.g., “Cloudy,” “Sunny”).
✔ Weather Emoji Representation: Displays appropriate emojis/icons based on weather conditions.
✔ Error Handling: Displays error messages if an invalid city is entered or if the API request fails.

How It Works
1️⃣ The user enters a city name in the input field.
2️⃣ The app sends an API request to OpenWeather with the provided city name.
3️⃣ If the request is successful, weather details (temperature, humidity, condition) are retrieved.
4️⃣ The UI updates dynamically to display the information with relevant emojis/icons.
5️⃣ If the API fails or the city is invalid, an error message is displayed.
